abstract: The high cost of healthcare delivery is a major driver of high medical spending in the United States. Recognizing this issue, federal and state policy has sought to reduce healthcare spending by lowering the cost of delivering healthcare. Cost-based interventions have ranged from changing payment systems to allowing hospitals to take advantage of economies of scale through mergers and acquisitions. Reforming medical labor markets is an understudied and increasingly common cost-based intervention. Medical labor markets are characterized by strict scope of practice (SOP) laws that regulate the services an occupation is allowed to perform within its license. To shed light on the effects of relaxing these laws I use plausibly exogenous variation in the strictness of SOP laws for Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs). Half of all states have relaxed their SOP laws to allow CNMs to practice and prescribe independently of a physician. I estimate the effect of granting CNMs full independence on hospital facility costs using administrative data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and inpatient discharge records from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Using a two-way fixed-effects model I find that allowing CNMs to practice independently substantially reduces hospital facility costs per birth and the use of intensive procedures, such as cesarean sections. These cost reductions are concentrated in hospitals without NICUs, serve patients from areas with few OBGYNs, and deliver relatively few births per obstetric bed. To investigate the causal mechanisms behind these cost savings I estimate changes in patient selection due to increased CNM independence using a non-parametric structural choice model. I use these estimates to decompose the overall effect of the policy into savings generated from increased hospital efficiency and changing selection of patients into hospitals. I find that the savings are primarily driven by increased hospital efficiency for low-risk patients. Higher risk patients select into higher cost hospitals after the law change. These effects are attenuated by market concentration and a high density of OBGYNs.
