I am a doctoral candidate in Economics at The University of Arizona and will be starting as an Economist at the Baylor College of Medicine and VA Houston through the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness and Safety (IQuEST). My research interests include the social safety net, pricing and concentration, and the healthcare workforce.
